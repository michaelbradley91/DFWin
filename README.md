# Dwarf Fortress for Windows (DFWin)
Firstly, please understand this game **is not Dwarf Fortress**. All credit for the underlying mechanics should go to Bay12Games:

Please lend them your support!

Dwarf Fortress is an **amazing game**, but I feel its user interface could be improved to make the game more accessible, so more people can have fun with it.

There are many existing tools out there for Dwarf Fortress, many of which are detailed in its [Wiki](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Utilities). 

[DFHack](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Utility:DFHack) in particular is probably the most advanced, analysing the game's memory allowing for some direct manipulation of the game. Please check it out as it might be a better fit for you.

**This project takes a radically different approach**.

## How it works

DFWin will constantly screenscrape Dwarf Fortress while the game runs in the background. By using a special tileset, DFWin can understand exactly what you would normally see on Dwarf Fortress's screen. When you play DFWin, it really sends key presses to Dwarf Fortress.

DFWin can choose to copy the Dwarf Fortress's UI exactly, which it does if it becomes confused so you can keep playing.

More importantly, DF Win can provide its own UI, and translate your interaction into key presses for the game. This allows it to rewire keys in the game with mouse clicks and so on to make it easier to play.

## How to use

1. Install Dwarf Fortress

To use DFWin, please change the tile set DF uses to the one in the repository.
This tile set is designed for DFWin to read the screen more easily.

Otherwise, have fun!
